# SDRSharp-Cleanup-Plugin


A nice SDR# plugin for Short Wave listening enthusiasts, and...more!

repo template shamelessly stolen from BlackApple62

# Version: 1.0 - 11 Jan 2024 - 

The files in this zip archive add a novel denoising method like Sdrsharp's denoiser which provides spectral gating capability and defect-free denoising on shortwave.  
<br>Not limited to VLF-HF! It can be used at any SDR# available frequency,
but for wideband, we recommend sdrsharp's other denoisers.
This Plugin is compiled for SDR# 32bit, with .NET 8 (SDR# Studio release >= 1920).
<br>Note: The plugin has not been tested and will not work on unsupported/older version o SDR# Studio and SDR#.

**New Setup:**
<br>**1.** Unzip the file SDRSharp.Plugin.Cleanup.zip
<br>**2.** Copy the SDRSharp.Cleanup.dll file and cleanup.dll file file into the SDR# Studio "Plugins" default folder
<br>**3.** Alternate, should you prefer, create your own folder inside the default "Plugins" it could be "Cleanup", and copy there the dlls instead.
<br>>SDRSharp will load your plugin at next execution.


This plugin is donated for *free* to the huge SDR# Studio users community.<br>
