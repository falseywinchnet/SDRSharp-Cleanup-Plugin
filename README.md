# Version: 1.0 - 11 Jan 2024 - # Version: 3.3 - 07 Jan 2024 - [![Github Downloads (total)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/falseywinchnet/SDRSharp-Cleanup-Plugin/3.3/total.svg)](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/SDRSharp-Cleanup-Plugin/releases/download/1.0/SDRSharp.Plugin.ListenInfo.zip)


The files in this zip archive add a novel denoising method like Sdrsharp's denoiser which provides spectral gating capability and defect-free denoising on shortwave, called cleanup. Cleanup is not limited to use with SDR#. https://github.com/falseywinchnet/Cleanup for more.
<br>Not limited to VLF-HF! It can be used at any SDR# available frequency, but for wideband, we recommend sdrsharp's other denoisers.
This Plugin is compiled for SDR# 32bit, with .NET 8 (SDR# Studio release >= 1920).
<br>Note: The plugin has not been tested and will not work on unsupported/older version o SDR# Studio and SDR#.

**New Setup:**
<br>**1.** Unzip the file SDRSharp.Plugin.Cleanup.zip
<br>**2.** Copy the SDRSharp.Cleanup.dll file and cleanup.dll file file into the SDR# Studio "Plugins" default folder
<br>**3.** Alternate, should you prefer, create your own folder inside the default "Plugins" it could be "Cleanup", and copy there the dlls instead.
<br>>SDRSharp will load your plugin at next execution.


This plugin is provided for *free* to the huge SDR# Studio users community.<br>
